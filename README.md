# FitnessApp
 
## Project Description

In this project we will develop a mobile application that will help the user live a healthier life. The application will encourage the user to excercise and help the user track their progress. The app will have many features such as creating a user profile, planning exercise, counting calories, and tracking user weight. 

## Accounts and Profiles

Our app will have the ability to save data from the user inside of our MongoDB database. We will also be storing other important information about our user like their weight, height, age, and preferred excercises. Users will be able to edit their own accounts information when they need to do so. They will also be able to delete their own account if they want to. Users will also be able to save preferences about their specific goals and excercise preferences.

## Calorie Counter

The app will have a calorie counting feature which will be attached to a database filled with common foods and their respective calorie values. Users can also input their own foods with calorie values. Calorie intake will be tracked across days/weeks/months/years to allow the user to ensure they are consistently eating the correct amount of calories.


## Planning Exercises

Our App will plan exercises for the user at the beginning of the week automatically. The exercises will be selected based on the users preferences and equipment availability.
